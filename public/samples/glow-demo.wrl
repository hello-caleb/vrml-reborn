## 📝 **Prompt for Other AIs to Generate .WRL Files**
```
Create a VRML 2.0 (.wrl) file that demonstrates 3D shapes and materials. 

Requirements:
- Start with exactly: #VRML V2.0 utf8
- Use Transform nodes with translation for positioning
- Include Shape nodes with:
  - geometry: Box, Sphere, Cylinder, or Cone
  - appearance/material with diffuseColor (RGB 0-1)
- Keep it simple: 3-5 objects maximum
- Use clean spacing and valid VRML 2.0 syntax

Example structure:
Transform {
  translation x y z
  children [
    Shape {
      geometry Sphere { radius 0.5 }
      appearance Appearance {
        material Material {
          diffuseColor 1 0 0
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

Create a small scene with a theme (e.g., "solar system", "forest", "city"). Make positioning intentional and visually clear.
