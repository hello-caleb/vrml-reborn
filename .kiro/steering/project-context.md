# VRML Reborn - Project Context

## Overview
VRML Reborn is a web application that converts legacy VRML (.wrl) files from the 1990s into modern WebXR experiences. Users can upload vintage 3D files and view them in their browser with full VR support.

## Tech Stack
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **React** - UI component framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **A-Frame** - WebXR rendering framework (HTML-like, works in any browser)

## Hackathon Details
- **Event**: Kiroween Hackathon 2025
- **Deadline**: December 5, 2025
- **Category**: Resurrection (bringing old tech back to life)
- **Bonus**: Startup Bonus eligible
- **Developer**: Caleb, founder of Rivrr (AI VR innovations)

## Project Goals
1. Parse VRML 1.0 and 2.0 file formats
2. Convert VRML nodes to A-Frame entities
3. Provide smooth upload and rendering experience
4. Enable VR mode for immersive viewing
5. Deploy to Vercel for easy sharing

## Development Notes
- Keep the parser extensible - start with basic shapes, add more node types incrementally
- Focus on user experience - fast loading, clear UI
- Test with real VRML files from the 90s web archives
